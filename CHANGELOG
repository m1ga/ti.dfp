1.1.1 - December 30, 2014

 - Merged PR #8 from timanrebel:

   - Added width/height to ad_received event, so it is easier to resize certain elements in the UI after loading an ad
 
   - adSizes now takes preference over adWidth/adHeight. Previously in 1.1.0 when no adWidth/Height, but adSizes were given, it would not work.


1.1.0 - December 29, 2014

- Merged pull request #5 from ddyy to make adWidth/adHeight work on iOS and to add smart banner size support for iOS

- Merged pull request #6 from timanrebel to add support for multiple ad sizes on iOS and 64-bit support

- Merged pull request #7 from timanrebel to add support for multiple ad sizes on android


1.0.1 - November 18, 2014

- Android: Updated to version 20 of google play services to match ti.cloudpush

- Android: Better exception handling

- Android: Moved most log calls to debug level

- iOS: updated to version 6.12.2 of Google Mobile Ads SDK for iOS

  (note -- I had a 1.0.1 version out there already for ios, but I don't want
  to get the version numbers out of sync for the two platforms, so I'm replacing
  ti.dfp-iphone-1.0.1.zip, which *was* using 6.12.0)
